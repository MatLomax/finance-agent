## Key Implementation Notes

### Architecture Principles
- **Pure Functions**: All business logic in `src/lib/` with no side effects
- **Native Web APIs**: No framework dependencies, use modern browser features
- **Educational Code**: Every function includes step-by-step explanations of financial concepts
- **Performance First**: Bundle size < 25KB, TTI < 300ms on 3G
- **Co-located Testing**: Each module file has its test file directly adjacent (no `__tests__` folders)

### Development Workflow
1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
2. **Quality Gates**: All checks must pass before commit (type check, lint, test, coverage, bundle size)
3. **Educational Documentation**: JSDoc with business context and formula explanations
4. **Detailed Commit Analysis**: AI agent must analyze all changes and provide comprehensive commit messages
5. **Automated Workflow**: Use `npm run ship` for complete development → release cycle
6. **Co-located Testing**: Test files are placed directly next to their corresponding source files
7. **Task Completion Protocol**: Upon completing any task, must:
   - Mark task as `[x] **COMPLETED**` in TASKS.md
   - Generate detailed commit message analyzing what changed, why, and impact
   - Verify deployment and version bump

### Commit Message Standards
Every commit must include:
- **Semantic prefix**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `perf:`
- **Detailed summary**: What files/functionality changed
- **Business motivation**: Why the change was necessary
- **Impact analysis**: How it affects users, performance, or architecture
- **Context**: Related requirements or architectural decisions

**Example**:
```
feat: implement memory-efficient LRU simulation cache with performance tracking

Add intelligent caching system to src/state/simulation-results.js with deterministic
key generation, automatic eviction (max 100 entries), and hit/miss statistics.
Includes comprehensive test suite covering normal operations, edge cases, and
memory management scenarios.

Motivation: Expensive financial simulations were being recalculated unnecessarily
when users made minor input adjustments, causing noticeable UI lag and poor UX
during interactive financial planning sessions.

Impact: Reduces calculation time by 80% for repeated scenarios, improves UI
responsiveness during user interactions, and maintains memory efficiency through
automatic LRU eviction preventing memory leaks.

Architecture: Follows pure functional design with immutable cache operations,
zero side effects, and predictable performance characteristics.
```

### Critical Dependencies
- **TypeBox**: Runtime validation (~2KB per schema)
- **lodash-es**: Utilities (~500B per function) - MUST use ES module version for tree-shaking
- **date-fns**: Date handling (~1.5KB per function)
- **esbuild**: Production bundling with minification and tree-shaking
- **Tree-shaking essential**: Use specific imports only for optimal bundle size

### Current Feature Parity
The modular version must maintain 100% feature parity with Thailand.html:
- All financial calculations identical
- Same default values and behavior
- Same dark theme design
- Same responsive layout
- Same localStorage persistence
- Enhanced: Better modularity, testing, and maintainability

### Estimated Completion
- **Simple tasks** (1.1, 1.2, 3.2, 7.1): 1-2 hours each
- **Medium tasks** (2.1, 2.3, 4.1, 4.2): 2-4 hours each  
- **Complex tasks** (2.2, 4.2 charts, 6.1): 4-6 hours each
- **Total estimated effort**: 40-60 hours of focused development

This transformation will result in a maintainable, testable, performant finance agent that serves as an excellent example of vanilla JavaScript architecture done right.
